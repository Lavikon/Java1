All of these vere automatically validated tasks, so I haven't pu in the effort to comment them properly or even use proper naming conventions. Instead opting for simple naming for variables such as a, b or i. Or b1 etc for booleans.
The primary goal for the code was simply to pass the validation and never to be used for much else, and was only meant for my own practice and learning. While following conventions and naming at all times is desirable, I opted to ignore it as it is extremely unlikely I would ever need to return this repository.
